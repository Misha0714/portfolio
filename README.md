# Computer Science and Quantitative Biology 

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of projects reflecting my journey as a driven sophomore pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Quantitative Biology and Computer Science. My academic pursuits revolve around integrating the disciplines of biology, computer science, and statistics to tackle real-world challenges using cutting-edge technology and data-driven approaches.

**About Me**

I am passionate about exploring the convergence of biology and technology, driven by the belief that innovative applications of AI and data analysis can revolutionize healthcare and beyond. As a student, I am eager to delve deeper into this intersection, whether through developing advanced AI systems or creating biomedical inventions.

**Projects Overview**
AI Image Classification:   
Several of my projects center around leveraging Python's AI tools for image classification tasks. These projects not only showcase my proficiency in Python programming but also highlight my interest in applying AI techniques to real-world datasets. I believe that with the utilization of computer vision many doors open up when it comes to building the next big and impactful technologies. 

Data Visualization with R:  

In addition to AI-focused projects, I also explore data visualization techniques using R. Through visualization, I aim to extract insights from complex datasets and communicate findings effectively. This R project demonstrates my proficiency in R programming and my ability to translate data into meaningful visual representations. Specifically, I visualize multi-omic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to represent the different mutations and survival rate of patients with different types of cancer. The types of visualizations I did include KM plots, co-oncoplots, lollipop plot, and volcano plot.
